# Welcome to TAD !

Tabular AD is AI content that identifies abnormal patterns and outliers within tabular data. 
It leverages machine learning-based unsupervised learning methodologies, allowing it to detect anomalies without the need for labeled data.
One of the primary advantages of Tabular AD is its ability to learn using only normal data, enabling high-accuracy anomaly detection even in the absence of outliers within the training set. 
Additionally, Tabular AD enhances performance by ensembling various machine learning models, thus overcoming the limitations of individual models and achieving more precise anomaly detection.
